# Slashy
A test of Discord's new slash commands and interaction webhooks, built in Golang.

You can try Slashy by [adding the slash commands to a server](https://go.maia.codes/slashy-invite), or by [joining the Slashy Discord server](https://discord.gg/UJbzPh77jZ).

## How it works
Slashy uses Discord's new Bot Interaction Endpoint for slash commands, meaning Discord sends a web request to a web server within Slashy for every interaction event.
